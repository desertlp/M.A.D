# M.A.D
Linkedin for Music

One of the music industry’s greatest achievements is the continued creation of unique sounds and personas, and ever-expanding sense of individuality. While we love something fresh and original, some things just need to be consistent for ease of comparison. One of those things is the portfolio. 

Major Art Departments is a web-based app that allows producers, directors, and agencies to search for set designers. The aim of M.A.D. is to make that search process simple, by keeping set designer’s portfolios consistently formatted, and ultimately allows the hiring agent to better determine which set designer’s work matches the artist’s style, is on point for what the producer needs, and that the set designer is comfortable, experienced, and compatible with the type of work that is required.
